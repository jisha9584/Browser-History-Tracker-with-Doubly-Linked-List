# Browser-History-Tracker-with-Doubly-Linked-List
This project involves implementing a browser history tracker using a doubly linked list in Python. It allows users to visit web pages, navigate backward and forward through their browsing history, and automatically filters out "bad" sites. The focus is on efficient history management and navigation control within a browser-like environment.
